While working through the book, this is a humble effort to collate my solutions to the 19th Edition of the Let Us C book by Yashwant Kanetkar.

At present these solutions are a collection of the "Programs" section of the Chapters and the section "Attempt the following questions" as given in the Exercises of the relevant chapters.

This repository is open for contributions.

In case of any legal or other issues, please write me at umishrak@gmail.com

The solutions contains the executable files. To run the executables in VS Code use the command `./(file name)`.

If you want to make the solutions from ground up use the command `make (file name)`.

If you are not having make install and this command does not work you can still make the executables by running the command
`gcc (file name.c) -o (file name)`

**Disclaimer:** There already is a book titled Solutions of Let Us C by Shri Yashwant Kanetkar, but the solutions collated here are not simple copy and paste from this book. You may come across several solutions that are my versions of the solutions to the given problems. At the same time, some solutions may be the same as those in the book.
