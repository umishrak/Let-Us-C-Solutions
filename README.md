# Let-Us-C-Solutions

![alt text](<Let Us C 19th Edition.png>)


While working through the book, this is a humble effort to collate my solutions to the 19th Edition of the Let Us C book by Yashwant Kanetkar.

At present these solutions are a collection of the "Programs" section of the Chapters and the section "Attempt the following questions" as given in the Exercises of the relevant chapters.

This repository is open for contributions.

In case of any legal or other issues, please write me at umishrak@gmail.com

Disclaimer: There already is a book titled Solutions of Let Us C by Shri Yashwant Kanetkar, but the solutions collated here are not simple copy and paste from this book. You may come across several solutions that are my versions of the solutions to the given problems. At the same time, some solutions may be the same as those in the book.
